# Certificate Splitter 🎓✨

Because Canva doesn't want you to have nice things.

## What it does
Takes your beautiful Canva certificate PDF with multiple pages and splits it into individual files named after each recipient. No more manual saving and renaming!

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyPDF2
- A Canva certificate PDF that you're too lazy to download one by one
- Coffee ☕

## Usage
1. Install PyPDF2: `pip install PyPDF2`
2. Put your PDF in same folder as script
3. Run script
4. Marvel at your newfound productivity

## Why this exists
Because clicking "Download" 100 times in Canva is nobody's idea of fun. Life's too short for repetitive tasks. 🦥

Made with 💝 and mild frustration at Canva's limitations.
